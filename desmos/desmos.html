But instead of just graphing sinxt,sinyt i tried to synthesize a saw wave and graph that. suprizingly it worked and it made these pretty patterns. cool huh? ALSO go to 'waveforms' to get more context on how i made the saw!! \n \n use the H sliders to change the hertz and V sliders to change the volume, \n the S slider is for the number of sine waves used to synthesize the saw (KEEP LOW FOR LOWER END DEVICES)\n  and the L slider is how much of the wave is displayed">simple ociliscope</button>

      <h1> DESMOS </h1>
      <p>I first started using desmos in about 2022, not really knowing HOW to use it but still enjoying making graphs by mashing together operaters.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After a few years of being <i>bad</i> at desmos i began using their help page to learn more about the features and actualy trying to make projects in the calculator. Now i have this page to showcase my occasional math reltated junk, most of these are flawed and very poorly written- BUT! they were made by me with hours of time. please enjoy <pre>&lt;:3</pre></pre></p>
